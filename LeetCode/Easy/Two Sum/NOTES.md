          Two Sum

          - Summary: This algorithm uses a hashmap (dictionary in Python) to efficiently find two numbers in a list that add up to a target value.  It iterates through the input list, checking for each number if its complement (target - number) exists in the hashmap. If found, it returns the indices of the two numbers; otherwise, it adds the current number and its index to the hashmap and continues. If no solution is found after iterating through the entire list, it returns an empty list.

          - Time Complexity: O(n) because the algorithm iterates through the input list once. Hashmap lookups are on average O(1).
          - Space Complexity: O(n) because in the worst-case scenario, the hashmap will store all the numbers from the input list.
